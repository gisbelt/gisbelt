### ¡Hi! 👋, my name is Gisbel Torres

▪️ I'll tell you a little about myself 💙
```
- I am passionate about tech and its new innovations. 
- Who wouldn't like to have someone passionate about tech in their team?
```
🤸‍♀️ Fun fact: I have an incredible virtue and the thing is that I always solve everything, 
I really do! I always find a way to solve anything no matter what.

### Let's talk about my skills:

▪️ I'm a frontend developer and web designer... or so I try
```
- I'm always learning about CSS3, HTML5, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Javascript, TypeScript, Jquery, Ajax..
- And nowadays about new technologies like React, NextJs, VueJs, Firebase, MongoDB, etc..
- I also know a bit about PHP, Laravel, Wordpress, MySql, Git, Github, AWS and Bash. 🤓
- Plus: I'm VERY good in the world of Linux
```
▪️ I SPEAK ENGLISH!
```
- At least at an intermediate level.
- It's not much but it's honest work 🤪. 
```
▪️ And last but not least, let's work together (but you know, remotely). 💁‍♀️
